+
+
+Background
+==========
+
+BitMap Queue CPU scheduler, referred to as BMQ from here on, is an evolution
+of previous Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue scheduler(PDS),
+and inspired by Zircon scheduler. The goal of it is to keep the scheduler code
+simple, while efficiency and scalable for interactive tasks, such as desktop,
+movie playback and gaming etc.
+
+Design
+======
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+BMQ use per CPU run queue design, each CPU(logical) has it's own run queue,
+each CPU is responsible for scheduling the tasks that are putting into it's
+run queue.
+
+The run queue is a set of priority queues. Note that these queues are fifo
+queue for non-rt tasks or priority queue for rt tasks in data structure. See
+BitMap Queue below for details. BMQ is optimized for non-rt tasks in the fact
+that most applications are non-rt tasks. No matter the queue is fifo or
+priority, In each queue is an ordered list of runnable tasks awaiting execution
+and the data structures are the same. When it is time for a new task to run,
+the scheduler simply looks the lowest numbered queueue that contains a task,
+and runs the first task from the head of that queue. And per CPU idle task is
+also in the run queue, so the scheduler can always find a task to run on from
+its run queue.
+
+Each task will assigned the same timeslice(default 4ms) when it is picked to
+start running. Task will be reinserted at the end of the appropriate priority
+queue when it uses its whole timeslice. When the scheduler selects a new task
+from the priority queue it sets the CPU's preemption timer for the remainder of
+the previous timeslice. When that timer fires the scheduler will stop execution
+on that task, select another task and start over again.
+
+If a task blocks waiting for a shared resource then it's taken out of its
+priority queue and is placed in a wait queue for the shared resource. When it
+is unblocked it will be reinserted in the appropriate priority queue of an
+eligible CPU.
+
+Task policy
+-----------
+
+BMQ supports DEADLINE, FIFO, RR, NORMAL, BATCH and IDLE task policy like the
+mainline CFS scheduler. But BMQ is heavy optimized for non-rt task, that's
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE policy tasks. Below is the implementation detail of each
+policy.
+
+DEADLINE
+	It is squashed as priority 0 FIFO task.
+
+FIFO/RR
+	All RT tasks share one single priority queue in BMQ run queue designed. The
+complexity of insert operation is O(n). BMQ is not designed for system runs
+with major rt policy tasks.
+
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE
+	BATCH and IDLE tasks are treated as the same policy. They compete CPU with
+NORMAL policy tasks, but they just don't boost. To control the priority of
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE tasks, simply use nice level.
+
+ISO
+	ISO policy is not supported in BMQ. Please use nice level -20 NORMAL policy
+task instead.
+
+Priority management
+-------------------
+
+RT tasks have priority from 0-99. For non-rt tasks, there are three different
+factors used to determine the effective priority of a task. The effective
+priority being what is used to determine which queue it will be in.
+
+The first factor is simply the task’s static priority. Which is assigned from
+task's nice level, within [-20, 19] in userland's point of view and [0, 39]
+internally.
+
+The second factor is the priority boost. This is a value bounded between
+[-MAX_PRIORITY_ADJ, MAX_PRIORITY_ADJ] used to offset the base priority, it is
+modified by the following cases:
+
+*When a thread has used up its entire timeslice, always deboost its boost by
+increasing by one.
+*When a thread gives up cpu control(voluntary or non-voluntary) to reschedule,
+and its switch-in time(time after last switch and run) below the thredhold
+based on its priority boost, will boost its boost by decreasing by one buti is
+capped at 0 (won’t go negative).
+
+The intent in this system is to ensure that interactive threads are serviced
+quickly. These are usually the threads that interact directly with the user
+and cause user-perceivable latency. These threads usually do little work and
+spend most of their time blocked awaiting another user event. So they get the
+priority boost from unblocking while background threads that do most of the
+processing receive the priority penalty for using their entire timeslice.

 #
 # P6_NOPs are a relatively minor optimization that require a family >=
 # 6 processor, except that it is broken on certain VIA chips.
 # Furthermore, AMD chips prefer a totally different sequence of NOPs
 # (which work on all CPUs).  In addition, it looks like Virtual PC
 # does not understand them.
 #
 # As a result, disallow these if we're not compiling for X86_64 (these
 # NOPs do work on all x86-64 capable chips); the list of processors in
 # the right-hand clause are the cores that benefit from this optimization.

+ *
+ * Some products ship by default with the SATA controller in "RAID" or
+ * "Intel RST Premium With Intel Optane System Acceleration" mode. Under this
+ * mode, which we refer to as "remapped NVMe" mode, any installed NVMe
+ * devices disappear from the PCI bus, and instead their I/O memory becomes
+ * available within the AHCI device BARs.
+ *
+ * This scheme is understood to be a way of avoiding usage of the standard
+ * Windows NVMe driver under that OS, instead mandating usage of Intel's
+ * driver instead, which has better power management, and presumably offers
+ * some RAID/disk-caching solutions too.
+ *
+ * Here in this driver, we support the remapped NVMe mode by claiming the
+ * AHCI device and creating a fake PCIe root port. On the new bus, the
+ * original AHCI device is exposed with only minor tweaks. Then, fake PCI
+ * devices corresponding to the remapped NVMe devices are created. The usual
+ * ahci and nvme drivers are then expected to bind to these devices and
+ * operate as normal.
+ *
+ * The PCI configuration space for the NVMe devices is completely
+ * unavailable, so we fake a minimal one and hope for the best.
+ *
+ * Interrupts are shared between the AHCI and NVMe devices. For simplicity,
+ * we only support the legacy interrupt here, although MSI support
+ * could potentially be added later.

+ *
+ *  rq1->lock
+ *    rq2->lock  where: rq1 < rq2
+ *
+ * Regular state:
+ *
+ * Normal scheduling state is serialized by rq->lock. __schedule() takes the
+ * local CPU's rq->lock, it optionally removes the task from the runqueue and
+ * always looks at the local rq data structures to find the most eligible task
+ * to run next.
+ *
+ * Task enqueue is also under rq->lock, possibly taken from another CPU.
+ * Wakeups from another LLC domain might use an IPI to transfer the enqueue to
+ * the local CPU to avoid bouncing the runqueue state around [ see
+ * ttwu_queue_wakelist() ]
+ *
+ * Task wakeup, specifically wakeups that involve migration, are horribly
+ * complicated to avoid having to take two rq->locks.
+ *
+ * Special state:
+ *
+ * System-calls and anything external will use task_rq_lock() which acquires
+ * both p->pi_lock and rq->lock. As a consequence the state they change is
+ * stable while holding either lock:
+ *
+ *  - sched_setaffinity()/
+ *    set_cpus_allowed_ptr():	p->cpus_ptr, p->nr_cpus_allowed
+ *  - set_user_nice():		p->se.load, p->*prio
+ *  - __sched_setscheduler():	p->sched_class, p->policy, p->*prio,
+ *				p->se.load, p->rt_priority,
+ *				p->dl.dl_{runtime, deadline, period, flags, bw, density}
+ *  - sched_setnuma():		p->numa_preferred_nid
+ *  - sched_move_task():        p->sched_task_group
+ *  - uclamp_update_active()	p->uclamp*
+ *
+ * p->state <- TASK_*:
+ *
+ *   is changed locklessly using set_current_state(), __set_current_state() or
+ *   set_special_state(), see their respective comments, or by
+ *   try_to_wake_up(). This latter uses p->pi_lock to serialize against
+ *   concurrent self.
+ *
+ * p->on_rq <- { 0, 1 = TASK_ON_RQ_QUEUED, 2 = TASK_ON_RQ_MIGRATING }:
+ *
+ *   is set by activate_task() and cleared by deactivate_task(), under
+ *   rq->lock. Non-zero indicates the task is runnable, the special
+ *   ON_RQ_MIGRATING state is used for migration without holding both
+ *   rq->locks. It indicates task_cpu() is not stable, see task_rq_lock().
+ *
+ * p->on_cpu <- { 0, 1 }:
+ *
+ *   is set by prepare_task() and cleared by finish_task() such that it will be
+ *   set before p is scheduled-in and cleared after p is scheduled-out, both
+ *   under rq->lock. Non-zero indicates the task is running on its CPU.
+ *
+ *   [ The astute reader will observe that it is possible for two tasks on one
+ *     CPU to have ->on_cpu = 1 at the same time. ]
+ *
+ * task_cpu(p): is changed by set_task_cpu(), the rules are:
+ *
+ *  - Don't call set_task_cpu() on a blocked task:
+ *
+ *    We don't care what CPU we're not running on, this simplifies hotplug,
+ *    the CPU assignment of blocked tasks isn't required to be valid.
+ *
+ *  - for try_to_wake_up(), called under p->pi_lock:
+ *
+ *    This allows try_to_wake_up() to only take one rq->lock, see its comment.
+ *
+ *  - for migration called under rq->lock:
+ *    [ see task_on_rq_migrating() in task_rq_lock() ]
+ *
+ *    o move_queued_task()
+ *    o detach_task()
+ *
+ *  - for migration called under double_rq_lock():
+ *
+ *    o __migrate_swap_task()

+ * Notes on Program-Order guarantees on SMP systems.
+ *
+ *  MIGRATION
+ *
+ * The basic program-order guarantee on SMP systems is that when a task [t]
+ * migrates, all its activity on its old CPU [c0] happens-before any subsequent
+ * execution on its new CPU [c1].
+ *
+ * For migration (of runnable tasks) this is provided by the following means:
+ *
+ *  A) UNLOCK of the rq(c0)->lock scheduling out task t
+ *  B) migration for t is required to synchronize *both* rq(c0)->lock and
+ *     rq(c1)->lock (if not at the same time, then in that order).
+ *  C) LOCK of the rq(c1)->lock scheduling in task
+ *
+ * Transitivity guarantees that B happens after A and C after B.
+ * Note: we only require RCpc transitivity.
+ * Note: the CPU doing B need not be c0 or c1
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0            CPU1            CPU2
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   sched-in Y
+ *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(0)->lock // orders against CPU0
+ *                                   dequeue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *                                   enqueue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *                   LOCK rq(1)->lock // orders against CPU2
+ *                   sched-out Z
+ *                   sched-in X
+ *                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *
+ *  BLOCKING -- aka. SLEEP + WAKEUP
+ *
+ * For blocking we (obviously) need to provide the same guarantee as for
+ * migration. However the means are completely different as there is no lock
+ * chain to provide order. Instead we do:
+ *
+ *   1) smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0)   -- finish_task()
+ *   2) smp_cond_load_acquire(!X->on_cpu) -- try_to_wake_up()
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0 (schedule)  CPU1 (try_to_wake_up) CPU2 (schedule)
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock LOCK X->pi_lock
+ *   dequeue X
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0);
+ *
+ *                    smp_cond_load_acquire(&X->on_cpu, !VAL);
+ *                    X->state = WAKING
+ *                    set_task_cpu(X,2)
+ *
+ *                    LOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *                    enqueue X
+ *                    X->state = RUNNING
+ *                    UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *
+ *                                          LOCK rq(2)->lock // orders against CPU1
+ *                                          sched-out Z
+ *                                          sched-in X
+ *                                          UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *
+ *                    UNLOCK X->pi_lock
+ *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *
+ * However; for wakeups there is a second guarantee we must provide, namely we
+ * must observe the state that lead to our wakeup. That is, not only must our
+ * task observe its own prior state, it must also observe the stores prior to
+ * its wakeup.
+ *
+ * This means that any means of doing remote wakeups must order the CPU doing
+ * the wakeup against the CPU the task is going to end up running on. This,
+ * however, is already required for the regular Program-Order guarantee above,
+ * since the waking CPU is the one issueing the ACQUIRE (smp_cond_load_acquire).

+ *   2. TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is checked on interrupt and userspace return

+	BBR2 TCP congestion control is a model-based congestion control
+	algorithm that aims to maximize network utilization, keep queues and
+	retransmit rates low, and to be able to coexist with Reno/CUBIC in
+	common scenarios. It builds an explicit model of the network path.  It
+	tolerates a targeted degree of random packet loss and delay that are
+	unrelated to congestion. It can operate over LAN, WAN, cellular, wifi,
+	or cable modem links, and can use DCTCP-L4S-style ECN signals.  It can
+	coexist with flows that use loss-based congestion control, and can
+	operate with shallow buffers, deep buffers, bufferbloat, policers, or
+	AQM schemes that do not provide a delay signal. It requires pacing,
+	using either TCP internal pacing or the fq ("Fair Queue") pacing packet

+/* BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control, v2
+ *
+ * BBRv2 is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low
+ * queues, low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model
+ * of the network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as
+ * (if they occur) packet loss and/or DCTCP/L4S-style ECN signals.  Note that
+ * although it can use ECN or loss signals explicitly, it does not require
+ * either; it can bound its in-flight data based on its estimate of the BDP.
+ *
+ * The model has both higher and lower bounds for the operating range:
+ *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
+ *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
+ * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
+ * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
+ * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
+ * than Reno and CUBIC.
+ *
+ * Here is a state transition diagram for BBR:
+ *
+ *             |
+ *             V

+ *    +---- PROBE_RTT <--+
+ *
+ * A BBR flow starts in STARTUP, and ramps up its sending rate quickly.
+ * When it estimates the pipe is full, it enters DRAIN to drain the queue.
+ * In steady state a BBR flow only uses PROBE_BW and PROBE_RTT.
+ * A long-lived BBR flow spends the vast majority of its time remaining
+ * (repeatedly) in PROBE_BW, fully probing and utilizing the pipe's bandwidth
+ * in a fair manner, with a small, bounded queue. *If* a flow has been
+ * continuously sending for the entire min_rtt window, and hasn't seen an RTT
+ * sample that matches or decreases its min_rtt estimate for 10 seconds, then
+ * it briefly enters PROBE_RTT to cut inflight to a minimum value to re-probe
+ * the path's two-way propagation delay (min_rtt). When exiting PROBE_RTT, if
+ * we estimated that we reached the full bw of the pipe then we enter PROBE_BW;
+ * otherwise we enter STARTUP to try to fill the pipe.
+ *
+ * BBR is described in detail in:
+ *   "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control",
+ *   Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, C. Stephen Gunn, Soheil Hassas Yeganeh,
+ *   Van Jacobson. ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016.
+ *
+ * There is a public e-mail list for discussing BBR development and testing:
+ *   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bbr-dev
+ *
+ * NOTE: BBR might be used with the fq qdisc ("man tc-fq") with pacing enabled,
+ * otherwise TCP stack falls back to an internal pacing using one high
+ * resolution timer per TCP socket and may use more resources.
