 Users can move charges associated with a task along with task migration, that
 is, uncharge task's pages from the old cgroup and charge them to the new cgroup.

+Pipe mode
+---------
+Pipe mode is a problem for Intel PT and possibly other auxtrace users.
+It's not recommended to use a pipe as data output with Intel PT because
+of the following reason.
+
+Essentially the auxtrace buffers do not behave like the regular perf
+event buffers.  That is because the head and tail are updated by
+software, but in the auxtrace case the data is written by hardware.
+So the head and tail do not get updated as data is written.
+
+In the Intel PT case, the head and tail are updated only when the trace
+is disabled by software, for example:
+    - full-trace, system wide : when buffer passes watermark
+    - full-trace, not system-wide : when buffer passes watermark or
+                                    context switches
+    - snapshot mode : as above but also when a snapshot is made
+    - sample mode : as above but also when a sample is made
+
+That means finished-round ordering doesn't work.  An auxtrace buffer
+can turn up that has data that extends back in time, possibly to the
+very beginning of tracing.
+
+For a perf.data file, that problem is solved by going through the trace
+and queuing up the auxtrace buffers in advance.
+
+For pipe mode, the order of events and timestamps can presumably
+be messed up.

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Enable background reclaim of hugepages

Use [defer+madvise] as default khugepaged defrag strategy:

For some reason, the default strategy to respond to THP fault fallbacks
is still just madvise, meaning stall if the program wants transparent
hugepages, but don't trigger a background reclaim / compaction if THP
begins to fail allocations.  This creates a snowball affect where we
still use the THP code paths, but we almost always fail once a system
has been active and busy for a while.

The option "defer" was created for interactive systems where THP can
still improve performance.  If we have to fallback to a regular page due
to an allocation failure or anything else, we will trigger a background
reclaim and compaction so future THP attempts succeed and previous
attempts eventually have their smaller pages combined without stalling
running applications.

We still want madvise to stall applications that explicitely want THP,
so defer+madvise _does_ make a ton of sense.  Make it the default for
interactive systems, especially if the kernel maintainer left
transparent hugepages on "always".

Reasoning and details in the original patch: https://lwn.net/Articles/711248/

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Tune mgLRU to protect cache used in the
 last second

Although not identical to the le9 patches that protect a byte-amount of
cache through tunables, multigenerational LRU now supports protecting
cache accessed in the last X milliseconds.

In #218, Yu recommends starting with 1000ms and tuning as needed.  This
looks like a safe default and turning on this feature should help users
that don't know they need it.

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Tune CFS for interactivity

5.7:
Take "sysctl_sched_nr_migrate" tune from early XanMod builds of 128. As
of 5.7, XanMod uses 256 but that may affect applications that require
timely response to IRQs.

5.15:
Per comment [1] on our ZEN INTERACTIVE commit, reducing the cost of
migration causes the system less responsive under high load.  Most
likely the combination of reduced migration cost + the higher number of
tasks that can be migrated at once contributes to this.

To better handle this situation, restore the mainline migration cost
value and also reduce the max number of tasks that can be migrated in
batch from 128 to 64.

If this doesn't help, we'll restore the reduced migration cost and keep
total number of tasks that can be migrated at once to 32.

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Tune ondemand governor for interactivity

4.10:
During some personal testing with the Dolphin emulator, MuQSS has
serious problems scaling its frequencies causing poor performance where
boosting the CPU frequencies would have fixed them.  Reducing the
up_threshold to 45 with MuQSS appears to fix the issue, letting the
introduction to "Star Wars: Rogue Leader" run at 100% speed versus about
80% on my test system.

Also, lets refactor the definitions and include some indentation to help
the reader discern what the scope of all the macros are.

5.4:
On the last custom kernel benchmark from Phoronix with Xanmod, Michael
configured all the kernels to run using ondemand instead of the kernel's
[default selection][1].  This reminded me that another option outside of
the kernels control is the user's choice to change the cpufreq governor,
for better or for worse.

In Liquorix, performance is the default governor whether you're running
acpi-cpufreq or intel-pstate.  I expect laptop users to install TLP or
LMT to control the power balance on their system, especially when
they're plugged in or on battery.  However, it's pretty clear to me a
lot of people would choose ondemand over performance since it's not
obvious it has huge performance ramifications with MuQSS, and ondemand
otherwise is "good enough" for most people.

Lets codify lower up thresholds for MuQSS to more closely synergize with
its aggressive thread migration behavior.  This way when ondemand is
configured, you get sort of a "performance-lite" type of result but with
the power savings you expect when leaving the running system idle.

[1]: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=xanmod-2020-kernel

5.14:
Although CFS and similar schedulers (BMQ, PDS, and CacULE), reuse a lot
more of mainline scheduling and do a good job of pinning single threaded
tasks to their respective core, there's still applications that
confusingly run steady near 50% and benefit from going full speed or
turbo when they need to run (emulators for more recent consoles come to
mind).

Drop the up threshold for all non-MuQSS schedulers from 80/95 to 55/60.

5.15:
Remove MuQSS cpufreq configuration.

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: Add OpenRGB patches

Squashed commit of the following:

commit 942ded8f8652a4b4e6b46d04938bb66f1eac4c78
Author: Steven Barrett <steven@liquorix.net>
Date:   Sat Jul 4 21:28:54 2020 -0500

    openrgb: Deduplicate piix4 setup for HUDSON2/KERNCZ SMBUS

    In the original OpenRGB patches, the initialization code for CZ
    secondary SMBus controllers was copied.  Later, an upstream commit
    landed in 5.7 stable that combined the initialization code for both
    primary/secondary smbus channels.

    Combine the initialization code ahead of time so upstream merges
    correctly with OpenRGB.

    Fixes: https://github.com/zen-kernel/zen-kernel/issues/176

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: PCI: Add Intel remapped NVMe device support

Contains:
  - PCI: Add Intel remapped NVMe device support

    Consumer products that are configured by default to run the Intel SATA AHCI
    controller in "RAID" or "Intel RST Premium With Intel Optane System
    Acceleration" mode are becoming increasingly prevalent.

    Unde this mode, NVMe devices are remapped into the SATA device and become
    hidden from the PCI bus, which means that Linux users cannot access their
    storage devices unless they go into the firmware setup menu to revert back
    to AHCI mode - assuming such option is available. Lack of support for this
    mode is also causing complications for vendors who distribute Linux.

    Add support for the remapped NVMe mode by creating a virtual PCI bus,
    where the AHCI and NVMe devices are presented separately, allowing the
    ahci and nvme drivers to bind in the normal way.

    Unfortunately the NVMe device configuration space is inaccesible under
    this scheme, so we provide a fake one, and hope that no DeviceID-based
    quirks are needed. The interrupt is shared between the AHCI and NVMe
    devices.

    Allow pci_real_dma_dev() to traverse back to the real DMA device from
    the PCI devices created on our virtual bus, in case the iommu driver
    will be involved with data transfers here.

    The existing ahci driver is modified to not claim devices where remapped
    NVMe devices are present, allowing this new driver to step in.

    The details of the remapping scheme came from patches previously
    posted by Dan Williams and the resulting discussion.

+ *
+ * Some products ship by default with the SATA controller in "RAID" or
+ * "Intel RST Premium With Intel Optane System Acceleration" mode. Under this
+ * mode, which we refer to as "remapped NVMe" mode, any installed NVMe
+ * devices disappear from the PCI bus, and instead their I/O memory becomes
+ * available within the AHCI device BARs.
+ *
+ * This scheme is understood to be a way of avoiding usage of the standard
+ * Windows NVMe driver under that OS, instead mandating usage of Intel's
+ * driver instead, which has better power management, and presumably offers
+ * some RAID/disk-caching solutions too.
+ *
+ * Here in this driver, we support the remapped NVMe mode by claiming the
+ * AHCI device and creating a fake PCIe root port. On the new bus, the
+ * original AHCI device is exposed with only minor tweaks. Then, fake PCI
+ * devices corresponding to the remapped NVMe devices are created. The usual
+ * ahci and nvme drivers are then expected to bind to these devices and
+ * operate as normal.
+ *
+ * The PCI configuration space for the NVMe devices is completely
+ * unavailable, so we fake a minimal one and hope for the best.
+ *
+ * Interrupts are shared between the AHCI and NVMe devices. For simplicity,
+ * we only support the legacy interrupt here, although MSI support
+ * could potentially be added later.

more uarches for kernel 5.17+

FEATURES
This patch adds additional CPU options to the Linux kernel accessible under:
 Processor type and features  --->
  Processor family --->

With the release of gcc 11.1 and clang 12.0, several generic 64-bit levels are
offered which are good for supported Intel or AMD CPUs:
• x86-64-v2
• x86-64-v3
• x86-64-v4

Users of glibc 2.33 and above can see which level is supported by current
hardware by running:
  /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported

Alternatively, compare the flags from /proc/cpuinfo to this list.[1]

CPU-specific microarchitectures include:
• AMD Improved K8-family
• AMD K10-family
• AMD Family 10h (Barcelona)
• AMD Family 14h (Bobcat)
• AMD Family 16h (Jaguar)
• AMD Family 15h (Bulldozer)
• AMD Family 15h (Piledriver)
• AMD Family 15h (Steamroller)
• AMD Family 15h (Excavator)
• AMD Family 17h (Zen)
• AMD Family 17h (Zen 2)
• AMD Family 19h (Zen 3)†
• AMD Family 19h (Zen 4)§
• Intel Silvermont low-power processors
• Intel Goldmont low-power processors (Apollo Lake and Denverton)
• Intel Goldmont Plus low-power processors (Gemini Lake)
• Intel 1st Gen Core i3/i5/i7 (Nehalem)
• Intel 1.5 Gen Core i3/i5/i7 (Westmere)
• Intel 2nd Gen Core i3/i5/i7 (Sandybridge)
• Intel 3rd Gen Core i3/i5/i7 (Ivybridge)
• Intel 4th Gen Core i3/i5/i7 (Haswell)
• Intel 5th Gen Core i3/i5/i7 (Broadwell)
• Intel 6th Gen Core i3/i5/i7 (Skylake)
• Intel 6th Gen Core i7/i9 (Skylake X)
• Intel 8th Gen Core i3/i5/i7 (Cannon Lake)
• Intel 10th Gen Core i7/i9 (Ice Lake)
• Intel Xeon (Cascade Lake)
• Intel Xeon (Cooper Lake)*
• Intel 3rd Gen 10nm++ i3/i5/i7/i9-family (Tiger Lake)*
• Intel 4th Gen 10nm++ Xeon (Sapphire Rapids)‡
• Intel 11th Gen i3/i5/i7/i9-family (Rocket Lake)‡
• Intel 12th Gen i3/i5/i7/i9-family (Alder Lake)‡
• Intel 13th Gen i3/i5/i7/i9-family (Raptor Lake)§
• Intel 14th Gen i3/i5/i7/i9-family (Meteor Lake)§
• Intel 5th Gen 10nm++ Xeon (Emerald Rapids)§

Notes: If not otherwise noted, gcc >=9.1 is required for support.
       *Requires gcc >=10.1 or clang >=10.0
       †Required gcc >=10.3 or clang >=12.0
       ‡Required gcc >=11.1 or clang >=12.0
       §Required gcc >=13.0 or clang >=15.0.5

It also offers to compile passing the 'native' option which, "selects the CPU
to generate code for at compilation time by determining the processor type of
the compiling machine. Using -march=native enables all instruction subsets
supported by the local machine and will produce code optimized for the local
machine under the constraints of the selected instruction set."[2]

Users of Intel CPUs should select the 'Intel-Native' option and users of AMD
CPUs should select the 'AMD-Native' option.

MINOR NOTES RELATING TO INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS
This patch also changes -march=atom to -march=bonnell in accordance with the
gcc v4.9 changes. Upstream is using the deprecated -match=atom flags when I
believe it should use the newer -march=bonnell flag for atom processors.[3]

It is not recommended to compile on Atom-CPUs with the 'native' option.[4] The
recommendation is to use the 'atom' option instead.

BENEFITS
Small but real speed increases are measurable using a make endpoint comparing
a generic kernel to one built with one of the respective microarchs.

See the following experimental evidence supporting this statement:

REQUIREMENTS
linux version 5.17+
gcc version >=9.0 or clang version >=9.0

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This patch builds on the seminal work by Jeroen.[5]

Subject: [PATCH 01/21] ACPI: CPPC: Add AMD pstate energy performance
 preference cppc control

Add support for setting and querying EPP preferences to the generic
CPPC driver.  This enables downstream drivers such as amd-pstate to discover
and use these values.

Downstream drivers that want to use the new symbols cppc_get_epp_caps
and cppc_set_epp_perf for querying and setting EPP preferences will need
to call cppc_set_epp_perf to enable the EPP function firstly.

Subject: [PATCH 02/21] Documentation: amd-pstate: add EPP profiles
 introduction

The amd-pstate driver supports a feature called energy performance
preference (EPP). Add information to the documentation to explain
how users can interact with the sysfs files for this feature.

1) See all EPP profiles
$ sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_available_preferences
default performance balance_performance balance_power power

2) Check current EPP profile
$ sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference
performance

3) Set new EPP profile
$ sudo bash -c "echo power > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference"

Subject: [PATCH 03/21] cpufreq: amd-pstate: optimize driver working mode
 selection in amd_pstate_param()

The amd-pstate driver may support multiple working modes.
Introduce a variable to keep track of which mode is currently enabled.
Here we use cppc_state var to indicate which mode is enabled.
This change will help to simplify the the amd_pstate_param() to choose
which mode used for the following driver registration.

Subject: [PATCH 04/21] cpufreq: amd-pstate: implement Pstate EPP support for
 the AMD processors

Add EPP driver support for AMD SoCs which support a dedicated MSR for
CPPC.  EPP is used by the DPM controller to configure the frequency that
a core operates at during short periods of activity.

The SoC EPP targets are configured on a scale from 0 to 255 where 0
represents maximum performance and 255 represents maximum efficiency.

The amd-pstate driver exports profile string names to userspace that are
tied to specific EPP values.

The balance_performance string (0x80) provides the best balance for
efficiency versus power on most systems, but users can choose other
strings to meet their needs as well.

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/energy_performance_available_preferences
default performance balance_performance balance_power power

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/energy_performance_preference
balance_performance

To enable the driver,it needs to add `amd_pstate=active` to kernel
command line and kernel will load the active mode epp driver

Subject: [PATCH 06/21] cpufreq: amd-pstate: implement suspend and resume
 callbacks

add suspend and resume support for the AMD processors by amd_pstate_epp
driver instance.

When the CPPC is suspended, EPP driver will set EPP profile to 'power'
profile and set max/min perf to lowest perf value.
When resume happens, it will restore the MSR registers with
previous cached value.

Subject: [PATCH 07/21] cpufreq: amd-pstate: add driver working mode switch
 support

While amd-pstate driver was loaded with specific driver mode, it will
need to check which mode is enabled for the pstate driver,add this sysfs
entry to show the current status

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd-pstate/status
active

Meanwhile, user can switch the pstate driver mode with writing mode
string to sysfs entry as below.

Enable passive mode:
$ sudo bash -c "echo passive >  /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd-pstate/status"

Enable active mode (EPP driver mode):
$ sudo bash -c "echo active > /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd-pstate/status"

-=========================================
+
+AMD Pstate Driver Operation Modes
+=================================
+
+``amd_pstate`` CPPC has two operation modes: CPPC Autonomous(active) mode and
+CPPC non-autonomous(passive) mode.
+active mode and passive mode can be chosen by different kernel parameters.
+When in Autonomous mode, CPPC ignores requests done in the Desired Performance
+Target register and takes into account only the values set to the Minimum requested
+performance, Maximum requested performance, and Energy Performance Preference
+registers. When Autonomous is disabled, it only considers the Desired Performance Target.
+
+Active Mode
+------------
+
+``amd_pstate=active``
+
+This is the low-level firmware control mode which is implemented by ``amd_pstate_epp``
+driver with ``amd_pstate=active`` passed to the kernel in the command line.
+In this mode, ``amd_pstate_epp`` driver provides a hint to the hardware if software
+wants to bias toward performance (0x0) or energy efficiency (0xff) to the CPPC firmware.
+then CPPC power algorithm will calculate the runtime workload and adjust the realtime
+cores frequency according to the power supply and thermal, core voltage and some other
+hardware conditions.
 
 Passive Mode

In autonomous mode SMU firmware decides frequencies at runtime
based on workload utilization, usage in other IPs, infrastructure
limits such as power, thermals and so on.

The amd-pstate driver supports switching working modes at runtime.
Users can view and change modes by interacting with the "status" sysfs
attribute.

1) check driver mode:
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd-pstate/status

2) switch mode:
`# echo "passive" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd-pstate/status`
or
`# echo "active" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd-pstate/status`

+User Space Interface in ``sysfs``
+=================================
+
+Global Attributes
+-----------------
+
+``amd-pstate`` exposes several global attributes (files) in ``sysfs`` to
+control its functionality at the system level.  They are located in the
+``/sys/devices/system/cpu/amd-pstate/`` directory and affect all CPUs.
+
+``status``
+	Operation mode of the driver: "active", "passive" or "disable".
+
+	"active"
+		The driver is functional and in the ``active mode``
+
+	"passive"
+		The driver is functional and in the ``passive mode``
+
+	"disable"
+		The driver is unregistered and not functional now.
+
+        This attribute can be written to in order to change the driver's
+        operation mode or to unregister it.  The string written to it must be
+        one of the possible values of it and, if successful, writing one of
+        these values to the sysfs file will cause the driver to switch over
+        to the operation mode represented by that string - or to be
+        unregistered in the "disable" case.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

All but a few drivers ignore the return value of
cpufreq_unregister_driver(). Those few that don't only call it after
cpufreq_register_driver() succeeded, in which case the call doesn't
fail.

Make the function return no value and add a WARN_ON for the case that
the function is called in an invalid situation (i.e. without a previous
successful call to cpufreq_register_driver()).

be written to guide the platform about min and max perf levels. Add this support
to make guided mode work properly on AMD shared memory systems.

Subject: [PATCH 14/21] acpi: cppc: Add auto select register read/write support

For some AMD shared memory based systems, the autonomous selection bit
needed to be set explicitly. Add autonomous selection register related
APIs to acpi driver, which amd_pstate driver uses later.

Subject: [PATCH 16/21] cpufreq: amd-pstate: Add guided autonomous mode

>From ACPI spec below 3 modes for CPPC can be defined:
1. Non autonomous: OS scaling governor specifies operating frequency/
   performance level through `Desired Performance` register and platform
follows that.
2. Guided autonomous: OS scaling governor specifies min and max
   frequencies/ performance levels through `Minimum Performance` and
`Maximum Performance` register, and platform can autonomously select an
operating frequency in this range.
3. Fully autonomous: OS only hints (via EPP) to platform for the required
   energy performance preference for the workload and platform autonomously
scales the frequency.

Currently (1) is supported by amd_pstate as passive mode, and (3) is
implemented by EPP support. This change is to support (2).

In guided autonomous mode the min_perf is based on the input from the
scaling governor. For example, in case of schedutil this value depends
on the current utilization. And max_perf is set to max capacity.

To activate guided auto mode ``amd_pstate=guided`` command line
parameter has to be passed in the kernel.

Subject: [PATCH 17/21] cpufreq: amd-pstate: Add guided mode control support
 via sysfs

amd_pstate driver's `status` sysfs entry helps to control the driver's
mode dynamically by user. After the addition of guided mode the
combinations of mode transitions have been increased (16 combinations).
Therefore optimise the amd_pstate_update_status function by implementing
a state transition table.

There are 4 states amd_pstate supports, namely: 'disable', 'passive',
'active', and 'guided'.  The transition from any state to any other
state is possible after this change.

Sysfs interface:

To disable amd_pstate driver:
 # echo disable > /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd_pstate/status

To enable passive mode:
 # echo passive > /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd_pstate/status

To change mode to active:
 # echo active > /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd_pstate/status

To change mode to guided:
 # echo guided > /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd_pstate/status

Subject: [PATCH 19/21] cpufreq: amd-pstate: avoid uninitialized variable use

The new epp support causes warnings about three separate
but related bugs:

1) failing before allocation should just return an error:

drivers/cpufreq/amd-pstate.c:951:6: error: variable 'ret' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
        if (!dev)
            ^~~~
drivers/cpufreq/amd-pstate.c:1018:9: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        return ret;
               ^~~

2) wrong variable to store return code:

drivers/cpufreq/amd-pstate.c:963:6: error: variable 'ret' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
        if (rc)
            ^~
drivers/cpufreq/amd-pstate.c:1019:9: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        return ret;
               ^~~
drivers/cpufreq/amd-pstate.c:963:2: note: remove the 'if' if its condition is always false
        if (rc)
        ^~~~~~~

3) calling amd_pstate_set_epp() in cleanup path after determining
that it should not be called:

drivers/cpufreq/amd-pstate.c:1055:6: error: variable 'epp' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
        if (cpudata->epp_policy == cpudata->policy)
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/cpufreq/amd-pstate.c:1080:30: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        amd_pstate_set_epp(cpudata, epp);
                                    ^~~

All three are trivial to fix, but most likely there are additional bugs
in this function when the error handling was not really tested.

Subject: [PATCH 20/21] cpufreq: amd_pstate: Fix invalid write to
 MSR_AMD_CPPC_REQ

`amd_pstate_set_epp` function uses `cppc_req_cached` and `epp` variable
to update the MSR_AMD_CPPC_REQ register for AMD MSR systems. The recent
commit 7cca9a9851a5 ("cpufreq: amd-pstate: avoid uninitialized variable
use") changed the sequence of updating cppc_req_cached and writing the
MSR_AMD_CPPC_REQ. Therefore while switching from powersave to
performance governor and vice-versa in active mode MSR_AMD_CPPC_REQ is
set with the previous cached value. To fix this: first update the
`cppc_req_cached` variable and then call `amd_pstate_set_epp` function.

- Before commit 7cca9a9851a5 ("cpufreq: amd-pstate: avoid uninitialized
variable use"):

With powersave governor:
[    1.652743] amd_pstate_epp_init: writing to cppc_req_cached = 0x1eff
[    1.652744] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing cppc_req_cached = 0x1eff
[    1.652746] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing min_perf = 30, des_perf = 0, max_perf = 255, epp = 0

Changing to performance governor:
[  300.493842] amd_pstate_epp_init: writing to cppc_req_cached = 0xffff
[  300.493846] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing cppc_req_cached = 0xffff
[  300.493847] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing min_perf = 255, des_perf = 0, max_perf = 255, epp = 0

- After commit 7cca9a9851a5 ("cpufreq: amd-pstate: avoid uninitialized
variable use"):

With powersave governor:
[    1.646037] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing cppc_req_cached = 0xffff
[    1.646038] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing min_perf = 255, des_perf = 0, max_perf = 255, epp = 0
[    1.646042] amd_pstate_epp_init: writing to cppc_req_cached = 0x1eff

Changing to performance governor:
[  687.117401] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing cppc_req_cached = 0x1eff
[  687.117405] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing min_perf = 30, des_perf = 0, max_perf = 255, epp = 0
[  687.117419] amd_pstate_epp_init: writing to cppc_req_cached = 0xffff

- After this fix:

With powersave governor:
[    2.525717] amd_pstate_epp_init: writing to cppc_req_cached = 0x1eff
[    2.525720] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing cppc_req_cached = 0x1eff
[    2.525722] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing min_perf = 30, des_perf = 0, max_perf = 255, epp = 0

Changing to performance governor:
[ 3440.152468] amd_pstate_epp_init: writing to cppc_req_cached = 0xffff
[ 3440.152473] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing cppc_req_cached = 0xffff
[ 3440.152474] amd_pstate_set_epp: writing min_perf = 255, des_perf = 0, max_perf = 255, epp = 0

+=====================================
+Wine synchronization primitive driver
+=====================================
+
+This page documents the user-space API for the winesync driver.
+
+winesync is a support driver for emulation of NT synchronization
+primitives by the Wine project or other NT emulators. It exists
+because implementation in user-space, using existing tools, cannot
+simultaneously satisfy performance, correctness, and security
+constraints. It is implemented entirely in software, and does not
+drive any hardware device.
+
+This interface is meant as a compatibility tool only, and should not
+be used for general synchronization. Instead use generic, versatile
+interfaces such as futex(2) and poll(2).
+
+Synchronization primitives
+==========================
+
+The winesync driver exposes two types of synchronization primitives,
+semaphores and mutexes.
+
+A semaphore holds a single volatile 32-bit counter, and a static
+32-bit integer denoting the maximum value. It is considered signaled
+when the counter is nonzero. The counter is decremented by one when a
+wait is satisfied. Both the initial and maximum count are established
+when the semaphore is created.
+
+A mutex holds a volatile 32-bit recursion count, and a volatile 32-bit
+identifier denoting its owner. A mutex is considered signaled when its
+owner is zero (indicating that it is not owned). The recursion count
+is incremented when a wait is satisfied, and ownership is set to the
+given identifier.
+
+A mutex also holds an internal flag denoting whether its previous
+owner has died; such a mutex is said to be inconsistent. Owner death
+is not tracked automatically based on thread death, but rather must be
+communicated using ``WINESYNC_IOC_KILL_OWNER``. An inconsistent mutex
+is inherently considered unowned.
+
+Except for the "unowned" semantics of zero, the actual value of the
+owner identifier is not interpreted by the winesync driver at all. The
+intended use is to store a thread identifier; however, the winesync
+driver does not actually validate that a calling thread provides
+consistent or unique identifiers.
+
+Unless specified otherwise, all operations on an object are atomic and
+totally ordered with respect to other operations on the same object.
+
+Objects are represented by unsigned 32-bit integers.
+
+Char device
+===========
+
+The winesync driver creates a single char device /dev/winesync. Each
+file description opened on the device represents a unique namespace.
+That is, objects created on one open file description are shared
+across all its individual descriptors, but are not shared with other
+open() calls on the same device. The same file description may be
+shared across multiple processes.
+
+ioctl reference
+===============
+
+All operations on the device are done through ioctls. There are three
+structures used in ioctl calls::
+
+   struct winesync_sem_args {
+   	__u32 sem;
+   	__u32 count;
+   	__u32 max;
+   };
+
+   struct winesync_mutex_args {
+   	__u32 mutex;
+   	__u32 owner;
+   	__u32 count;
+   };
+
+   struct winesync_wait_args {
+   	__u64 timeout;
+   	__u64 objs;
+   	__u32 count;
+   	__u32 owner;
+   	__u32 index;
+   	__u32 pad;
+   };
+
+Depending on the ioctl, members of the structure may be used as input,
+output, or not at all. All ioctls return 0 on success.
+
+The ioctls are as follows:
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_CREATE_SEM
+
+  Create a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - On output, contains the identifier of the created semaphore.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Initial count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - Maximum count of the semaphore.
+
+  Fails with ``EINVAL`` if ``count`` is greater than ``max``.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_CREATE_MUTEX
+
+  Create a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - On output, contains the identifier of the created mutex.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Initial recursion count of the mutex.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Initial owner of the mutex.
+
+  If ``owner`` is nonzero and ``count`` is zero, or if ``owner`` is
+  zero and ``count`` is nonzero, the function fails with ``EINVAL``.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_DELETE
+
+  Delete an object of any type. Takes an input-only pointer to a
+  32-bit integer denoting the object to delete.
+
+  Wait ioctls currently in progress are not interrupted, and behave as
+  if the object remains valid.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_PUT_SEM
+
+  Post to a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - Semaphore object to post to.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Count to add to the semaphore. On output, contains the
+         previous count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - Not used.
+
+  If adding ``count`` to the semaphore's current count would raise the
+  latter past the semaphore's maximum count, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOVERFLOW`` and the semaphore is not affected. If raising the
+  semaphore's count causes it to become signaled, eligible threads
+  waiting on this semaphore will be woken and the semaphore's count
+  decremented appropriately.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_PUT_MUTEX
+
+  Release a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - Mutex object to release.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Mutex owner identifier.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the previous recursion count.
+
+  If ``owner`` is zero, the ioctl fails with ``EINVAL``. If ``owner``
+  is not the current owner of the mutex, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EPERM``.
+
+  The mutex's count will be decremented by one. If decrementing the
+  mutex's count causes it to become zero, the mutex is marked as
+  unowned and signaled, and eligible threads waiting on it will be
+  woken as appropriate.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_READ_SEM
+
+  Read the current state of a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to
+  struct :c:type:`winesync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - Semaphore object to read.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the current count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - On output, contains the maximum count of the semaphore.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_READ_MUTEX
+
+  Read the current state of a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - Mutex object to read.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - On output, contains the current owner of the mutex, or zero
+         if the mutex is not currently owned.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the current recursion count of the mutex.
+
+  If the mutex is marked as inconsistent, the function fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. In this case, ``count`` and ``owner`` are set to
+  zero.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_KILL_OWNER
+
+  Mark any mutexes owned by the given owner as unowned and
+  inconsistent. Takes an input-only pointer to a 32-bit integer
+  denoting the owner. If the owner is zero, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EINVAL``.
+
+  For each mutex currently owned by the given owner, eligible threads
+  waiting on said mutex will be woken as appropriate (and such waits
+  will fail with ``EOWNERDEAD``, as described below).
+
+  The operation as a whole is not atomic; however, the modification of
+  each mutex is atomic and totally ordered with respect to other
+  operations on the same mutex.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY
+
+  Poll on any of a list of objects, atomically acquiring at most one.
+  Takes a pointer to struct :c:type:`winesync_wait_args`, which is
+  used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``timeout``
+       - Optional pointer to a 64-bit struct :c:type:`timespec`
+         (specified as an integer so that the structure has the same
+         size regardless of architecture). The timeout is specified in
+         absolute format, as measured against the MONOTONIC clock. If
+         the timeout is equal to or earlier than the current time, the
+         function returns immediately without sleeping. If ``timeout``
+         is zero, i.e. NULL, the function will sleep until an object
+         is signaled, and will not fail with ``ETIMEDOUT``.
+     * - ``objs``
+       - Pointer to an array of ``count`` 32-bit object identifiers
+         (specified as an integer so that the structure has the same
+         size regardless of architecture). If any identifier is
+         invalid, the function fails with ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Number of object identifiers specified in the ``objs`` array.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Mutex owner identifier. If any object in ``objs`` is a mutex,
+         the ioctl will attempt to acquire that mutex on behalf of
+         ``owner``. If ``owner`` is zero, the ioctl fails with
+         ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``index``
+       - On success, contains the index (into ``objs``) of the object
+         which was signaled.
+     * - ``pad``
+       - This field is not used and must be set to zero.
+
+  This function attempts to acquire one of the given objects. If
+  unable to do so, it sleeps until an object becomes signaled,
+  subsequently acquiring it, or the timeout expires. In the latter
+  case the ioctl fails with ``ETIMEDOUT``. The function only acquires
+  one object, even if multiple objects are signaled.
+
+  A semaphore is considered to be signaled if its count is nonzero,
+  and is acquired by decrementing its count by one. A mutex is
+  considered to be signaled if it is unowned or if its owner matches
+  the ``owner`` argument, and is acquired by incrementing its
+  recursion count by one and setting its owner to the ``owner``
+  argument.
+
+  Acquisition is atomic and totally ordered with respect to other
+  operations on the same object. If two wait operations (with
+  different ``owner`` identifiers) are queued on the same mutex, only
+  one is signaled. If two wait operations are queued on the same
+  semaphore, and a value of one is posted to it, only one is signaled.
+  The order in which threads are signaled is not specified.
+
+  If an inconsistent mutex is acquired, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. Although this is a failure return, the function may
+  otherwise be considered successful. The mutex is marked as owned by
+  the given owner (with a recursion count of 1) and as no longer
+  inconsistent, and ``index`` is still set to the index of the mutex.
+
+  It is valid to pass the same object more than once. If a wakeup
+  occurs due to that object being signaled, ``index`` is set to the
+  lowest index corresponding to that object.
+
+  The function may fail with ``EINTR`` if a signal is received.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ALL
+
+  Poll on a list of objects, atomically acquiring all of them. Takes a
+  pointer to struct :c:type:`winesync_wait_args`, which is used
+  identically to ``WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, except that ``index`` is
+  always filled with zero on success.
+
+  This function attempts to simultaneously acquire all of the given
+  objects. If unable to do so, it sleeps until all objects become
+  simultaneously signaled, subsequently acquiring them, or the timeout
+  expires. In the latter case the ioctl fails with ``ETIMEDOUT`` and
+  no objects are modified.
+
+  Objects may become signaled and subsequently designaled (through
+  acquisition by other threads) while this thread is sleeping. Only
+  once all objects are simultaneously signaled does the ioctl acquire
+  them and return. The entire acquisition is atomic and totally
+  ordered with respect to other operations on any of the given
+  objects.
+
+  If an inconsistent mutex is acquired, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. Similarly to ``WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, all objects
+  are nevertheless marked as acquired. Note that if multiple mutex
+  objects are specified, there is no way to know which were marked as
+  inconsistent.
+
+  Unlike ``WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, it is not valid to pass the same
+  object more than once. If this is attempted, the function fails with
+  ``EINVAL``.

+/* BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control, v2
+ *
+ * BBRv2 is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low
+ * queues, low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model
+ * of the network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as
+ * (if they occur) packet loss and/or DCTCP/L4S-style ECN signals.  Note that
+ * although it can use ECN or loss signals explicitly, it does not require
+ * either; it can bound its in-flight data based on its estimate of the BDP.
+ *
+ * The model has both higher and lower bounds for the operating range:
+ *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
+ *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
+ * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
+ * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
+ * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
+ * than Reno and CUBIC.
+ *
+ * Here is a state transition diagram for BBR:

+ *    +---- PROBE_RTT <--+
+ *
+ * A BBR flow starts in STARTUP, and ramps up its sending rate quickly.
+ * When it estimates the pipe is full, it enters DRAIN to drain the queue.
+ * In steady state a BBR flow only uses PROBE_BW and PROBE_RTT.
+ * A long-lived BBR flow spends the vast majority of its time remaining
+ * (repeatedly) in PROBE_BW, fully probing and utilizing the pipe's bandwidth
+ * in a fair manner, with a small, bounded queue. *If* a flow has been
+ * continuously sending for the entire min_rtt window, and hasn't seen an RTT
+ * sample that matches or decreases its min_rtt estimate for 10 seconds, then
+ * it briefly enters PROBE_RTT to cut inflight to a minimum value to re-probe
+ * the path's two-way propagation delay (min_rtt). When exiting PROBE_RTT, if
+ * we estimated that we reached the full bw of the pipe then we enter PROBE_BW;
+ * otherwise we enter STARTUP to try to fill the pipe.
+ *
+ * BBR is described in detail in:
+ *   "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control",
+ *   Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, C. Stephen Gunn, Soheil Hassas Yeganeh,
+ *   Van Jacobson. ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016.
+ *
+ * There is a public e-mail list for discussing BBR development and testing:
+ *   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bbr-dev
+ *
+ * NOTE: BBR might be used with the fq qdisc ("man tc-fq") with pacing enabled,
+ * otherwise TCP stack falls back to an internal pacing using one high
+ * resolution timer per TCP socket and may use more resources.
